## Long Questions — 8

1. Discuss the main regex concepts from the notes, including raw strings, character classes, predefined classes, quantifiers, boundaries, and regex functions such as match, search, findall, and sub.
2. Explain the debugging exercises in the notes and show how each bug is corrected.
3. Discuss threads in detail, including process versus thread, shared memory, the GIL, I/O-bound work, race conditions, locks, joins, semaphores, events, and silent thread exceptions.
4. Explain the Django MVT architecture with reference to models, views, templates, and URL configuration, and describe a complete request cycle.
5. Compare Django’s model, ORM, view, template, and URL routing with the concepts introduced in earlier units as described in the notes.
6. Illustrate how regex can be used to solve the practice tasks on phone number extraction, student record parsing, password checking, and log analysis using patterns from the notes.
7. Describe how a multi-threaded word frequency counter or library search can be implemented using threads and a Lock, and explain why the Lock is necessary.
8. Evaluate the significance of the unit summary and checklist themes: regex, threads, and Django, and explain how the topics connect to one another in the course.
