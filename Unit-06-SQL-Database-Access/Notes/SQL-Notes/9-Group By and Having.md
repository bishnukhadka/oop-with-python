# 9. GROUP BY and HAVING

`GROUP BY` and `HAVING` are used to create summaries from grouped data. They are commonly used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()`.

```text
Employees

    Department

        IT
        IT
        HR
      Finance
        HR


        │
        ▼

    GROUP BY department


        │
        ▼


IT       → 2 employees
HR       → 2 employees
Finance  → 1 employee
```

# I. GROUP BY

`GROUP BY` combines rows that have the same value into groups. It is often used with aggregate functions to calculate summaries for each group.

```sql
SELECT department,
COUNT(*) AS employee_count

FROM employees

GROUP BY department;
```

The query counts how many employees belong to each department.

| department | employee_count |
|------------|---------------:|
| HR | 2 |
| IT | 2 |
| Finance | 1 |


```text
Before GROUP BY

John      HR
Jane      IT
Alice     Finance
Bob       IT
Emily     HR


After GROUP BY

HR
 └── John
 └── Emily
     Count = 2


IT
 └── Jane
 └── Bob
     Count = 2


Finance
 └── Alice
     Count = 1
```

> 💡 **Tip:** `GROUP BY` reduces multiple rows into summary groups. It is usually paired with aggregate functions.


### Example: Find Average Salary by Department

Calculate the average salary for each department.

```sql
SELECT
department,
AVG(salary) AS average_salary

FROM employees

GROUP BY department;
```


| department | average_salary |
|------------|---------------:|
| HR | 49000.00 |
| IT | 61000.00 |
| Finance | 55000.00 |


Example 3: Find Total Salary Paid by Department

Calculate the total salary expense for each department.

```sql
SELECT
department,
SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

| department | total_salary |
|------------|-------------:|
| HR | 98000.00 |
| IT | 122000.00 |
| Finance | 55000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** A common SQL analysis pattern is:
>
> ```sql
> SELECT category, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(value)
> FROM table
> GROUP BY category;
> ```
>
> This pattern is used heavily in business reports, dashboards, and data analytics.

>**Note**: `GROUP BY` collapses many rows into fewer rows. Once rows are grouped, SQL cannot return individual columns like first_name or salary unless you tell it how to combine them. If you want every employee row, use `SELECT` (possibly with ORDER BY), not `GROUP BY`.
>Therefore, the following does not work. 
>```SELECT *
>FROM employees
>GROUP BY department;
>```

# II. HAVING

`HAVING` filters the results **after grouping**. It is similar to `WHERE`, but it works with grouped data and aggregate functions.

```sql
SELECT department,
AVG(salary) AS avg_salary

FROM employees

GROUP BY department

HAVING AVG(salary)>55000;
```

### Result

Only departments where the **average salary is greater than 55,000** are returned.

| department | avg_salary |
|------------|-----------:|
| IT | 61000.00 |

---

# WHERE vs HAVING

| WHERE | HAVING |
|-------|--------|
| Filters rows before grouping | Filters groups after grouping |
| Works with individual records | Works with aggregate results |
| Used before `GROUP BY` | Used after `GROUP BY` |

Example:

```sql
-- Filter employees first

SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
GROUP BY department;
```

```sql
-- Filter grouped results

SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 55000;
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Think of the order like this:
>
> ```text
> SELECT
>   ↓
> FROM
>   ↓
> WHERE
>   ↓
> GROUP BY
>   ↓
> HAVING
>   ↓
> ORDER BY
> ```
