# 3. Query Data

SQL uses **SELECT** to retrieve information.

## SELECT

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

Returns every column and every row.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary | new_column |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|------------|
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 | NULL |
| 2 | Jane | Smith | IT | 60000.00 | NULL |
| 3 | Alice | Johnson | Finance | 55000.00 | NULL |
| 4 | Bob | Williams | IT | 62000.00 | NULL |
| 5 | Emily | Brown | HR | 48000.00 | NULL |

---

## DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
```

Returns unique department names.

`DISTINCT` returns only the unique values from a column, removing any duplicates.

| department |
|------------|
| HR |
| IT |
| Finance |

> 💡 **Tip:** Even though the `employees` table has multiple employees in the **HR** and **IT** departments, `DISTINCT` returns each department only once.

```sql
SELECT department FROM employees;
```

Without `DISTINCT`, SQL returns **every value**, including duplicates.

| department |
|------------|
| HR |
| IT |
| Finance |
| IT |
| HR |

> 💡 **Tip:** Use `DISTINCT` when you only want the unique values from a column. Without it, SQL returns all matching rows, including duplicates.

## WHERE

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 55000;
```

Filters rows based on a condition.

---

## LIMIT

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
LIMIT 3;
```

`LIMIT` restricts the maximum number of rows returned by a query. It is commonly used to preview data or retrieve only a subset of records.

The `WHERE` clause filters the rows and returns only employees whose **salary is greater than 55,000**.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 2 | Jane | Smith | IT | 60000.00 |
| 4 | Bob | Williams | IT | 62000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `WHERE` is used to filter records based on a condition. Only rows that satisfy the condition (`salary > 55000`) are returned.

---

## OFFSET

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 2;
```

Skips the first 2 rows.

`OFFSET 2` skips the **first 2 rows**, and `LIMIT 10000` allows SQL to return up to **10,000 rows** after that. Since the table only has 5 rows, only the remaining 3 rows are returned.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 3 | Alice | Johnson | Finance | 55000.00 |
| 4 | Bob | Williams | IT | 62000.00 |
| 5 | Emily | Brown | HR | 48000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `OFFSET` specifies **how many rows to skip**, while `LIMIT` specifies **how many rows to return** after skipping those rows.

---

## FETCH

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
```

Alternative to LIMIT in SQL standard.

`FETCH FIRST` retrieves only the specified number of rows from the query result. Here, it returns the **first 3 rows** from the `employees` table.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 |
| 2 | Jane | Smith | IT | 60000.00 |
| 3 | Alice | Johnson | Finance | 55000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `FETCH FIRST` is the SQL standard way to limit query results. It works similarly to `LIMIT` in many databases.

## CASE

```sql
SELECT
first_name,
last_name,

CASE
WHEN salary > 55000 THEN 'High'
WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'Medium'
ELSE 'Low'
END AS salary_category

FROM employees;
```

Creates conditional values.

The `CASE` statement works like an **IF-ELSE condition** in SQL. It checks each employee's salary and creates a new column called **`salary_category`** based on the salary range.

| first_name | last_name | salary_category |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| John | Doe | Low |
| Jane | Smith | High |
| Alice | Johnson | Medium |
| Bob | Williams | High |
| Emily | Brown | Low |

> 💡 **Tip:** `CASE` allows you to create custom categories or labels based on conditions.
