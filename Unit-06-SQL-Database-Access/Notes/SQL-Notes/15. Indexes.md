# 15. Indexes

Indexes are database structures that **improve query performance** by allowing SQL to find data faster without scanning every row in a table.

Think of an index like the **index section of a book**. Instead of reading every page to find a topic, you can look up the keyword and jump directly to the correct page.

```text
Without Index

Employees Table

Row 1
Row 2
Row 3
...
Row 100000

        │
        ▼

Search every row

        │
        ▼

Slow Query


----------------------------


With Index

Index

Department → Row Location

        │
        ▼

Direct Lookup

        │
        ▼

Fast Query
```

# Why Use Indexes?

Without an index:

```sql
SELECT *

FROM employees

WHERE department='IT';
```

SQL may need to check every row:

```text
Row 1 → HR       ❌
Row 2 → IT       ✅
Row 3 → Finance  ❌
Row 4 → IT       ✅
...
Row 100000 → IT  ✅
```

With an index:

```text
Department Index

Finance  → Rows 3, 8, 15
HR       → Rows 1, 5, 9
IT       → Rows 2, 4, 20


Search: IT

        ↓

Jump directly to IT rows
```

# CREATE INDEX

The `CREATE INDEX` statement creates an index on one or more columns.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department

ON employees(department);
```

This creates an index named `idx_department` on the `department` column.

---

## Example

Employees Table:

| employee_id | first_name | department |
|------------:|------------|------------|
| 1 | John | HR |
| 2 | Jane | IT |
| 3 | Alice | Finance |
| 4 | Bob | IT |

Create index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department

ON employees(department);
```

SQL creates a lookup structure:

```text
Index

Finance → Row 3

HR      → Row 1

IT      → Row 2, Row 4
```

Now this query can run faster:

```sql
SELECT *

FROM employees

WHERE department='IT';
```

---

# Multiple Column Index

Indexes can also be created using multiple columns.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_search

ON employees(department, salary);
```

This helps queries like:

```sql
SELECT *

FROM employees

WHERE department='IT'

AND salary > 60000;
```

---

# DROP INDEX

The `DROP INDEX` statement removes an existing index.

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_department;
```

After removing the index:

```text
Index

IT → Row 2, Row 4

        ❌ Removed


SQL returns to normal searching
```

---

# When Should You Use Indexes?

Indexes are useful for columns that are frequently used in:

```sql
WHERE
ORDER BY
JOIN
GROUP BY
```

Examples:

```sql
-- Searching

WHERE email='john@email.com'


-- Sorting

ORDER BY salary DESC


-- Joining tables

ON employees.department_id =
departments.department_id
```

# Index Advantages and Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Faster data retrieval | Uses additional storage |
| Improves search performance | Slows INSERT operations |
| Helps JOIN operations | Slows UPDATE and DELETE slightly |

---

# Index Summary

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| CREATE INDEX | Creates a new index |
| DROP INDEX | Removes an index |

```text
No Index

Search → Scan Everything → Slow


Index

Search → Lookup → Fast
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Indexes make reading data faster, but they add extra work when inserting, updating, or deleting records. Use them on columns that are searched frequently.
