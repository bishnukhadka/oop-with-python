# 6. Filter Data

Filtering allows you to retrieve only the data you need.

---

## WHERE

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department='IT';
```

Only employees who belong to the **IT department** are returned.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 2 | Jane | Smith | IT | 60000.00 |
| 4 | Bob | Williams | IT | 62000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `WHERE` is one of the most commonly used SQL clauses. It helps narrow down results by checking conditions such as values, ranges, patterns, and NULL values.

---

## LIKE

The `LIKE` operator is used to search for a specific **pattern** in text values. It is commonly used with wildcard characters:

| Wildcard | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `%` | Matches zero or more characters | `J%` matches John, Jane, Jack |
| `_` | Matches exactly one character | `J_n` matches Jan, Jon |

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';
```

Matches patterns.

```
J%
│
├── John ✔
├── Jane ✔
└── Alice ✘
```
The query returns all employees whose **first name starts with the letter "J"**.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 |
| 2 | Jane | Smith | IT | 60000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** The `%` wildcard represents any number of characters after `J`. This means `J%` matches names like John, Jane, and Jack, but not Alice.

**More Examples:**
```sql
-- Names ending with "n"
WHERE first_name LIKE '%n';

-- Names containing "oh"
WHERE first_name LIKE '%oh%';

-- Names with exactly 4 characters
WHERE first_name LIKE '____';
```
---

## IN

The `IN` operator is used to filter data by checking whether a value matches **any value in a given list**. It is a shorter and cleaner alternative to using multiple `OR` conditions.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('HR','Finance');
```

The query returns employees who belong to either the **HR** or **Finance** departments.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 |
| 3 | Alice | Johnson | Finance | 55000.00 |
| 5 | Emily | Brown | HR | 48000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `IN` checks multiple possible values at once.

---

## BETWEEN

The `BETWEEN` operator is used to filter values that fall **within a specific range**. It includes both the starting and ending values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 60000;
```

The query returns employees whose salary is **between 50,000 and 60,000 (inclusive)**.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 |
| 2 | Jane | Smith | IT | 60000.00 |
| 3 | Alice | Johnson | Finance | 55000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `BETWEEN` includes the boundary values.
>
> `BETWEEN 50000 AND 60000` means:
>
> - Salary ≥ 50,000 ✅
> - Salary ≤ 60,000 ✅

```text
Salary Range

48000     50000          55000          60000     62000
 │          │              │              │          │
 ✘          ✔              ✔              ✔          ✘

          BETWEEN 50000 AND 60000
          └──────────────────────┘
```
---

## IS NULL

The `IS NULL` operator is used to find records where a column has **no value assigned**. `NULL` represents missing, unknown, or unavailable data.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NULL;
```

### Result

The query returns employees whose **department information is missing**.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 6 | David | Miller | NULL | 52000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `NULL` is not the same as `0`, an empty string (`''`), or a blank space. It means the value is unknown or not provided.
>
> Use:
>
> ```sql
> IS NULL
> ```
>
> to find missing values.
>
> Use:
>
> ```sql
> IS NOT NULL
> ```
>
> to find records where a value exists.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE new_column IS NULL;
```
Result:

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary | new_column |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|------------|
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 | NULL |
| 2 | Jane | Smith | IT | 60000.00 | NULL |
| 3 | Alice | Johnson | Finance | 55000.00 | NULL |
| 4 | Bob | Williams | IT | 62000.00 | NULL |
| 5 | Emily | Brown | HR | 48000.00 | NULL |

---

## ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to **sort the result set** based on one or more columns. By default, SQL sorts values in ascending order, but you can specify the direction.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

### Result

The query sorts employees by **salary from highest to lowest** using `DESC` (descending order).

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 4 | Bob | Williams | IT | 62000.00 |
| 2 | Jane | Smith | IT | 60000.00 |
| 3 | Alice | Johnson | Finance | 55000.00 |
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 |
| 5 | Emily | Brown | HR | 48000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:**  
> - `ASC` → Sorts from smallest to largest (default)  
> - `DESC` → Sorts from largest to smallest  
>
> Example:
>
> ```sql
> ORDER BY salary ASC;
> ```
>
> returns the lowest-paid employees first.
