# 7. SQL Operators

Operators are used to **combine, compare, and filter conditions** in SQL queries. They help you create more specific searches by applying multiple rules.

```text
Condition 1
     +
Condition 2
     +
Condition 3

       ↓

Filtered Results
```

---

## AND

The `AND` operator returns records only when **all conditions are true**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department='IT'
AND salary>60000;
```

Both conditions must match:

- Department must be **IT**
- Salary must be **greater than 60,000**

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 4 | Bob | Williams | IT | 62000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `AND` makes your filter more specific. A row must satisfy every condition to appear in the result.

```text
Employee        Department     Salary      Result

John            HR             50000       ❌
Jane            IT             60000       ❌
Alice           Finance        55000       ❌
Bob             IT             62000       ✅
Emily           HR             48000       ❌


IT + Salary > 60000
        ↓
       Bob
```

---

## OR

The `OR` operator returns records when **at least one condition is true**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department='HR'
OR department='Finance';
```

Employees from either **HR** or **Finance** departments are returned.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 |
| 3 | Alice | Johnson | Finance | 55000.00 |
| 5 | Emily | Brown | HR | 48000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `OR` expands your search by allowing multiple possible conditions.

```text
Department

HR        ✅
IT        ❌
Finance   ✅
IT        ❌
HR        ✅


HR OR Finance

↓

John
Alice
Emily
```

---

## NOT

The `NOT` operator reverses a condition. It returns rows that **do not match** the given condition.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE NOT department='IT';
```

Employees who are **not** in the IT department are returned.

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 |
| 3 | Alice | Johnson | Finance | 55000.00 |
| 5 | Emily | Brown | HR | 48000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `NOT` is useful when you want to exclude specific values.

```text
Department

John     HR        ✅
Jane     IT        ❌
Alice    Finance   ✅
Bob      IT        ❌
Emily    HR        ✅


NOT IT
   ↓
HR + Finance employees
```

---

## Combining Operators

SQL operators can be combined to create complex filters.

Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department='IT'
AND salary BETWEEN 60000 AND 70000;
```

Meaning:

```text
Department = IT
        +
Salary between 60000 and 70000

        ↓

Matching Employees
```
