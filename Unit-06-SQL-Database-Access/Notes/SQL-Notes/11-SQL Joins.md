# 11. SQL Joins

Joins are used to **combine data from multiple tables** based on a related column.

Most real-world databases store information across multiple tables. Joins help bring that related information together into a single result.

```text
Employees Table              Departments Table

employee_id                  department_id
first_name                   department_name
department_id               

John       1                 1   HR
Jane       2                 2   IT
Bob        2                 3   Finance


          Match department_id

                ↓

            Joined Result

            John      HR
            Jane      IT
            Bob       IT
```

> 💡 **Tip:** A JOIN usually connects a `FOREIGN KEY` in one table with a `PRIMARY KEY` in another table.

---

# INNER JOIN

`INNER JOIN` returns only rows where there is a **matching value in both tables**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### Example

Employees:

| employee_id | first_name | department_id |
|------------:|------------|--------------:|
| 1 | John | 1 |
| 2 | Jane | 2 |
| 3 | Bob | 2 |
| 4 | Alice | NULL |

Departments:

| department_id | department_name |
|--------------:|-----------------|
| 1 | HR |
| 2 | IT |
| 3 | Finance |

### Result

| first_name | department_name |
|------------|-----------------|
| John | HR |
| Jane | IT |
| Bob | IT |

Alice is not included because she has no matching department.

### Visual

```text
Employees             Departments

John  ───────►        HR       ✅
Jane  ───────►        IT       ✅
Bob   ───────►        IT       ✅
Alice ───────►        NULL     ❌


INNER JOIN

Returns only matching rows
```

---

# LEFT JOIN

`LEFT JOIN` returns **all rows from the left table** and matching rows from the right table.

```sql
SELECT *\
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### Result

| first_name | department_name |
|------------|-----------------|
| John | HR |
| Jane | IT |
| Bob | IT |
| Alice | NULL |

### Visual

```text
Employees              Departments

John  ───────►         HR
Jane  ───────►         IT
Bob   ───────►         IT
Alice ───────►         NULL


LEFT JOIN

Keep ALL employees
```

> 💡 **Tip:** LEFT JOIN is useful when you want to find records that may not have a match.

Example:

```sql
Find all employees,
including employees without departments.
```

---

# RIGHT JOIN

`RIGHT JOIN` returns **all rows from the right table** and matching rows from the left table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id =
departments.department_id;
```

### Result

| first_name | department_name |
|------------|-----------------|
| John | HR |
| Jane | IT |
| Bob | IT |
| NULL | Finance |

Finance appears even though no employee belongs to it.

### Visual

```text
Employees              Departments

John  ───────►         HR
Jane  ───────►         IT
Bob   ───────►         IT
NULL  ◄───────         Finance


RIGHT JOIN

Keep ALL departments
```

---

# FULL OUTER JOIN

`FULL OUTER JOIN` returns **all records from both tables**. Matching rows are combined, and unmatched rows are shown with NULL values.

```sql
SELECT *

FROM employees

FULL OUTER JOIN departments

ON employees.department_id =
departments.department_id;
```

### Result

| first_name | department_name |
|------------|-----------------|
| John | HR |
| Jane | IT |
| Bob | IT |
| Alice | NULL |
| NULL | Finance |

### Visual

```text
Employees              Departments

John   ───────►        HR
Jane   ───────►        IT
Bob    ───────►        IT
Alice  ───────►        NULL
NULL   ◄───────        Finance


FULL OUTER JOIN

Keep everything
```

---

# CROSS JOIN

`CROSS JOIN` creates every possible combination between two tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

### Example

Employees:

| employee |
|----------|
| John |
| Jane |

Departments:

| department |
|------------|
| HR |
| IT |

### Result

| employee | department |
|----------|------------|
| John | HR |
| John | IT |
| Jane | HR |
| Jane | IT |

### Visual

```text
Employees × Departments


John
 ├── HR
 └── IT


Jane
 ├── HR
 └── IT


Total combinations = 2 × 2 = 4
```

> 💡 **Tip:** CROSS JOIN is useful for generating combinations, but it can create very large results.

---

# SELF JOIN

A `SELF JOIN` joins a table with itself. It is useful when rows in the same table have relationships with each other.

Example: Employees and their managers.

### Employees Table

| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
|------------:|---------------|-----------:|
| 1 | John | NULL |
| 2 | Jane | 1 |
| 3 | Bob | 1 |

Here, `manager_id` points back to another employee.

```sql
SELECT

e1.employee_name AS employee,
e2.employee_name AS manager

FROM employees e1

JOIN employees e2

ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

### Result

| employee | manager |
|----------|---------|
| Jane | John |
| Bob | John |

### Visual

```text
Employees Table


John
 │
 ├── Jane
 │
 └── Bob


SELF JOIN

Employee → Manager
```

# SQL Join Summary

| Join Type | Returns |
|-----------|---------|
| INNER JOIN | Only matching records from both tables |
| LEFT JOIN | All records from left table + matches |
| RIGHT JOIN | All records from right table + matches |
| FULL OUTER JOIN | All records from both tables |
| CROSS JOIN | Every possible combination |
| SELF JOIN | A table joined with itself |
