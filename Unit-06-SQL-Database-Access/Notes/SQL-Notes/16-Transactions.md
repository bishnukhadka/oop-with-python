# 16. Transactions

Transactions are a group of SQL operations treated as **one single unit of work**. They ensure that database changes are completed safely and consistently.

A transaction follows the idea:

> **All operations succeed → Save changes**  
> **Something fails → Undo changes**

# Why Use Transactions?

Imagine transferring money between two bank accounts:

```text
Account A

$1000

        ↓
     Transfer $200

        ↓

Account B

$500
```

The database must perform two actions:

```text
1. Subtract $200 from Account A

2. Add $200 to Account B
```

What happens if step 1 succeeds but step 2 fails?

```text
Account A

$800  ✅


Account B

$500  ❌


Money disappeared!
```

A transaction prevents this by making both actions succeed or fail together.

# BEGIN TRANSACTION

`BEGIN TRANSACTION` starts a new transaction.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```

After this command, SQL starts tracking all changes.

### Example

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 200
WHERE account_id = 1;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 200
WHERE account_id = 2;
```

Changes are not permanently saved yet.

```text
BEGIN
   ↓
UPDATE
   ↓
Waiting for decision
   ↓
COMMIT or ROLLBACK
```

---

# COMMIT

`COMMIT` permanently saves all changes made during the transaction.

```sql
COMMIT;
```

### Example

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE employees
SET salary = 60000
WHERE employee_id = 1;

COMMIT;
```

Result:

```text
Before

John
Salary = 50000


UPDATE


After COMMIT

John
Salary = 60000
```

Changes are now permanent.

---

# ROLLBACK

`ROLLBACK` cancels all changes made during the current transaction.

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

### Example

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE employees
SET salary = 60000
WHERE employee_id = 1;


-- Something goes wrong

ROLLBACK;
```

Result:

```text
Before

John
Salary = 50000


UPDATE

John
Salary = 60000


ROLLBACK


After

John
Salary = 50000
```

The database returns to its previous state.

# Transaction Example

## Successful Transaction

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + 5000
WHERE department='IT';

COMMIT;
```

Flow:

```text
BEGIN
  ↓
Increase IT salaries
  ↓
Everything OK
  ↓
COMMIT
  ↓
Changes Saved
```

---

## Failed Transaction

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + 5000
WHERE department='IT';


-- Error occurs


ROLLBACK;
```

Flow:

```text
BEGIN
  ↓
Update Data
  ↓
Error Found
  ↓
ROLLBACK
  ↓
Changes Removed
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Transactions are essential for operations where data accuracy matters, such as payments, orders, inventory updates, and banking systems.
