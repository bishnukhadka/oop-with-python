The `DELETE` statement removes existing records from a table. Here, the employee record with **employee_id = 5** is deleted from the `employees` table.

| 4 | Bob | Williams | IT | 62000.00 |

| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|------------:|------------|-----------|------------|--------:|
| 1 | John | Doe | HR | 50000.00 |
| 2 | Jane | Smith | IT | 60000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `DELETE` permanently removes rows from a table. Always use a `WHERE` clause to specify which records should be deleted. Without `WHERE`, all rows in the table will be removed.
