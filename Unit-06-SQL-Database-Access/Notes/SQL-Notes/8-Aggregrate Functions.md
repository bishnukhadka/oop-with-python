# 8. Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on **multiple rows** and return a single summary value. They are commonly used for reports, analytics, and understanding large datasets.


## COUNT

`COUNT()` counts the number of rows or non-NULL values in a column.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employees;
```

### Result

Returns the total number of employees.

| COUNT(*) |
|---------:|
| 5 |


> 💡 **Tip:** `COUNT(*)` counts all rows, including rows containing NULL values.

---

## SUM

`SUM()` adds together all numeric values in a column.

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary)
FROM employees;
```

Calculates the total salary paid to all employees.

| SUM(salary) |
|------------:|
| 270000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** `SUM()` works with numeric columns such as salary, price, quantity, or revenue.

---

## AVG

`AVG()` calculates the average value of a numeric column.

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM employees;
```

Calculates the average employee salary.

| AVG(salary) |
|------------:|
| 54000.00 |


> 💡 **Tip:** `AVG()` returns the mean value of all records.

---

## MIN

`MIN()` finds the smallest value in a column.

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary)
FROM employees;
```

Returns the lowest salary.

| MIN(salary) |
|------------:|
| 48000.00 |


---

## MAX

`MAX()` finds the largest value in a column.

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employees;
```

Returns the highest salary.

| MAX(salary) |
|------------:|
| 62000.00 |

---

## Combining Aggregate Functions

You can use multiple aggregate functions in one query.

```sql
SELECT
COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
SUM(salary) AS total_salary,
AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary,
MAX(salary) AS highest_salary

FROM employees;
```

| total_employees | total_salary | average_salary | lowest_salary | highest_salary |
|----------------:|-------------:|---------------:|--------------:|---------------:|
| 5 | 270000.00 | 54000.00 | 48000.00 | 62000.00 |

> 💡 **Tip:** Aggregate functions are usually combined with `GROUP BY` when you want summaries for different categories, such as average salary by department.
